# Adicord: an AI based Discord chat bot

The bot functions on the latest playground settings of OpenAI and uses one of the GPT-3.5 models `gpt-turbo-3.5-16k-0613` for generating responses. This is a free, open-source, and yet very simple bot to learn. The resources used in this bot are completely free, due to which the bot might not function sometimes, but still, I will try my best to keep the logs in check.

## Tech stacks used:

### discord.py 
Discord.py is a Python library that enables developers to interact with the Discord API to create bots and applications for the Discord platform. Discord itself is a popular communication platform primarily aimed at gamers, allowing users to communicate via text, voice, and video in real-time.

### OpenAI API and chat playground
OpenAI provides access to its various language models and APIs through API keys. These keys are used to authenticate and authorize access to OpenAI's services, allowing developers to integrate them into their applications and projects. The API keys ensure that only authorized users can access OpenAI's models and services, helping to protect the resources and maintain the integrity of the platform.

One of the offerings provided by OpenAI is the Chat Playground, which is a web-based interface that allows users to interact with language models such as GPT-3 (the model behind ChatGPT) in a conversational manner.
